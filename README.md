# earthquake-visualization

This systemâ€™s data is from USGS. It is a webapp based on Echarts to display real-time
visualization of earthquakes that occurred in the world in the last month, updated every five minutes.
This is a user-friendly web application, and also is a nice tool to see earthquakes occurred in the
world. And the visualization results confirm the theory of plate tectonics.
